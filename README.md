## SUMMARY

Full Stack Developer with extensive experience in developing and maintaining web applications using PHP and JavaScript on various frameworks. Passionate about learning new technologies and improving application performance and user experience. I have been coding for over 5 years.

I am flexible, easy to communicate with, and I love coffee because a programmer is a person who processes coffee into code, and I drink good coffee. I always use best practices, write clean code, and am open to feedback about my work.
